## 1.1.0 - 2022-07-29

* Added
  * Support for nested/bundled (sub-)components via `Models.Component.components` was added, including
    serialization/normalization of models and impact on dependency graphs rendering. ([#132] via [#136])

## 1.0.0 - 2022-06-20

Initial release.

* Responsibilities
  * Provide a general purpose _JavaScript_-implementation of [_CycloneDX_][CycloneDX] for _Node.js_ and _WebBrowsers_.
  * Provide typing for said implementation, so developers and dev-tools can rely on it.
  * Provide data models to work with _CycloneDX_.
  * Provide a JSON- and an XML-normalizer, that...
    * supports all shipped data models.
    * respects any injected [_CycloneDX_ Specification][CycloneDX-specification] and generates valid output according to it.
    * can be configured to generate reproducible/deterministic output.
    * can prepare data structures for JSON- and XML-serialization.
  * Serialization:
    * Provide a universal JSON-serializer for all target environments.
    * Provide an XML-serializer for all target environments.
    * Support the downstream implementation of custom XML-serializers tailored to specific environments  
      by providing an abstract base class that takes care of normalization and BomRef-discrimination.  
      This is done, because there is no universal XML support in _JavaScript_.
* Capabilities & Features
  * Enums for the following use cases:
    * `AttachmentEncoding`
    * `ComponentScope`
    * `ComponentType`
    * `ExternalReferenceType`
    * `HashAlgorithm`
  * Data models for the following use cases:
    * `Attachment`
    * `Bom`
    * `BomRef`, `BomRefRepository`
    * `Component`, `ComponentRepository`
    * `ExternalReference`, `ExternalReferenceRepository`
    * `HashContent`, `Hash`, `HashRepository`
    * `LicenseExpression`, `NamedLicense`, `SpdxLicense`, `LicenseRepository`
    * `Metadata`
    * `OrganizationalContact`, `OrganizationalContactRepository`
    * `OrganizationalEntity`
    * `SWID`
    * `Tool`, `ToolRepository`
  * Factories for the following use cases:
    * Create data models from any license descriptor string
    * Specific to _Node.js_: create data models from PackageJson-like data structures
  * Builders for the following use cases:
    * Specific to _Node.js_: create deep data models from PackageJson-like data structures
  * Implementation of the [_CycloneDX_ Specification][CycloneDX-specification] for the following versions:
    * `1.4`
    * `1.3`
    * `1.2`
  * Normalizers that convert data models to JSON structures
  * Normalizers that convert data models to XML structures
  * Universal serializer that converts `Bom` data models to JSON string
  * Serializer that converts `Bom` data models to XML string:
    * Specific to _WebBrowsers_: implementation utilizes browser-specific document generators and printers.
    * Specific to _Node.js_: implementation plugs/requires/utilizes one of the following _optional_ libraries
      * [xmlbuilder2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xmlbuilder2)
