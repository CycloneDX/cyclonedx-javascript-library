# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## unreleased

* BREAKING
  * Interface `Spec.Protocol` was removed from public API ([#957] via [#958])  
    This is only a breaking change if you custom-implemented this TypeScript interface downstream; internal usage is non-breaking.  
    This change was necessary, so that implementing more spec-features cause no breaking changes.
* Build
  * Use _TypeScript_ `v5.2.2` now, was `v5.1.6` (via [#966])

  * Revisited sort and compare:
    * Methods `Models.*.compare()` may return different numbers than before.
    * Methods `Models.*.sorted()` may return different orders than before.
  * Removed deprecated symbols ([#747] via [#752])

      You may use `Factories.LicenseFactory.makeExpression()` to mimic the previous behavior.
    * Property `expression` setter no longer throws, when value is not eligible ([#530] via [#547])  
      You may use `Factories.LicenseFactory.makeExpression()` to mimic the previous behavior.

    * Property `content` was widened to be any stringable, was `string` ([#406], [#516] via [#753])  
      This enables the use of `Buffer` and other data-saving mechanisms.
  * Class `Models.Component` was modified
    * Property `copyright` was widened to be any stringable, was `string` ([#406], [#516] via [#753])  
      This enables the use of `Buffer` and other data-saving mechanisms.
  * Class `Models.Vulnerability.Credits` was modified
    * Property `organizations` is no longer optional (via [#722])  
      This collection(`Set`) will always exist, but might be empty.

## 1.14.0 -- 2023-04-25

* Added
  * Formal validators for JSON string and XML string ([#620] via [#652], [#691])  
    Currently available only for _Node.js_. Requires [optional dependencies](README.md#optional-dependencies).
    * Related new validator classes:
      * `Validation.JsonValidator`
      * `Validation.JsonStrictValidator`
      * `Validation.XmlValidator`
    * Related new error classes:
      * `Validation.NotImplementedError`
      * `Validation.MissingOptionalDependencyError`
* Build

## 1.13.3 - 2023-04-05

* Fixed
  * `Serialize.{JSON,XML}.Normalize.LicenseNormalizer.normalizeIterable()` now omits invalid license combinations ([#602] via [#623])  
    If there is any `Models.LicenseExpression`, then this is the only license normalized; otherwise all licenses are normalized.
* Docs
  * Fixed link to CycloneDX-specification in README (via [#617])

## 1.13.2 - 2023-03-29

* Fixed
  * `Builders.FromNodePackageJson.ComponentBuilder` no longer cuts component's name after a slash(`/`) ([#599] via [#600])

[#599]: https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-javascript-library/issues/599
[#600]: https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-javascript-library/pull/600

## 1.13.1 - 2023-03-28

* Docs
  * Announce and annotate the generator for BOM's SerialNumber ([#588] via [#598])
  
[#598]: https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-javascript-library/pull/598

## 1.13.0 - 2023-03-28

* Fixed
  * "Bom.serialNumber" data model can have values following the alternative format allowed in CycloneDX XML specification ([#588] via [#597])
  * `Serialize.{JSON,XML}.Normalize.BomNormalizer.normalize` now omits invalid/unsupported values for serialNumber ([#588] via [#597])
* Changed
  * Property `Models.Bom.serialNumber` is of type `string`, was type-aliased `Types.UrnUuid = string` ([#588] via [#597])  
    Also, the setter no longer throws exceptions, since no string format is illegal.  
    This is considered a non-breaking behavior change, because the corresponding normalizers assure valid data results.
* Added
  * Published generator for BOM's SerialNumber: `Utils.BomUtility.randomSerialNumber()` ([#588] via [#597])  
    The code was donated from [cyclonedx-node-npm](https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-node-npm/).
* Deprecation
  * Type alias `Types.UrnUuid = string` became deprecated (via [#597])  
    Use type `string` instead.
  * Function `Types.isUrnUuid` became deprecated (via [#597])

## 1.12.1 - 2023-03-13

Maintenance release.

## 1.12.0 - 2023-03-02

* Docs
  * Made it clear, that `{Builders,Factories}.{FromNodePackageJson,FromPackageJson}.*` functionality is to be run on already normalized structures ([#517] via [#518])  
    Normalization should be done downstream, for example via [`normalize-package-data`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/normalize-package-data).

## 1.0.0 - 2022-06-20

Initial release.

* Responsibilities
  * Provide a general purpose _JavaScript_-implementation of [_CycloneDX_][CycloneDX] for _Node.js_ and _WebBrowsers_.
  * Provide typing for said implementation, so developers and dev-tools can rely on it.
  * Provide data models to work with _CycloneDX_.
  * Provide a JSON- and an XML-normalizer, that...
    * supports all shipped data models.
    * respects any injected [_CycloneDX_ Specification][CycloneDX-specification] and generates valid output according to it.
    * can be configured to generate reproducible/deterministic output.
    * can prepare data structures for JSON- and XML-serialization.
  * Serialization:
    * Provide a universal JSON-serializer for all target environments.
    * Provide an XML-serializer for all target environments.
    * Support the downstream implementation of custom XML-serializers tailored to specific environments  
      by providing an abstract base class that takes care of normalization and BomRef-discrimination.  
      This is done, because there is no universal XML support in _JavaScript_.
* Capabilities & Features

    * `Metadata`
    * `OrganizationalContact`, `OrganizationalContactRepository`
    * `OrganizationalEntity`
    * `SWID`
    * `Tool`, `ToolRepository`
  * Factories for the following use cases:
    * Create data models from any license descriptor string
    * Specific to _Node.js_: create data models from PackageJson-like data structures
  * Builders for the following use cases:
    * Specific to _Node.js_: create deep data models from PackageJson-like data structures
  * Implementation of the [_CycloneDX_ Specification][CycloneDX-specification] for the following versions:
    * `1.4`
    * `1.3`
    * `1.2`
  * Normalizers that convert data models to JSON structures
  * Normalizers that convert data models to XML structures
  * Universal serializer that converts `Bom` data models to JSON string
  * Serializer that converts `Bom` data models to XML string:
    * Specific to _WebBrowsers_: implementation utilizes browser-specific document generators and printers.
    * Specific to _Node.js_: implementation plugs/requires/utilizes one of the following _optional_ libraries
      * [xmlbuilder2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xmlbuilder2)
