# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## unreleased

* Breaking Changes:
  * Class `Factories.LicenseFactory` was modified
    * Function `makeFromString()` was changed in its behaviour ([#271], [#530] via [#547])
      Will try to create `Models.SpdxLicense` if value is eligible,
      else try to create `Models.LicenseExpression` if value is eligible, 
      else fall back to `Models.NamedLicense`.
    * Renamed function `makeDisjunctiveWithId()` -> `makeSpdxLicense()` ([#530] via [#547])
    * Renamed function `makeDisjunctiveWithName()` -> `makeNamedLicense()` ([#530] via [#547])
  * Class `Models.LicenseExpression` was modified
    * Removed static function `isEligibleExpression()` (via [#547])  
      Use `Spdx.isValidSpdxLicenseExpression()` instead.
    * Constructor no longer throws, when value is not eligible ([#530] via [#547])
      You may utilize `Factories.LicenseFactory` to mimic the previous behaviour.
    * Property `expression` setter no longer throws, when value is not eligible ([#530] via [#547])
      You may utilize `Factories.LicenseFactory` to mimic the previous behaviour.
  * Class `Models.SpdxLicense` was modified

## 1.14.0 -- 2023-04-25

* Added
  * Formal validators for JSON string and XML string ([#620] via [#652], [#691])  
    Currently available only for _Node.js_. Requires [optional dependencies](README.md#optional-dependencies).
    * Related new validator classes:
      * `Validation.JsonValidator`
      * `Validation.JsonStrictValidator`
      * `Validation.XmlValidator`
    * Related new error classes:
      * `Validation.NotImplementedError`
      * `Validation.MissingOptionalDependencyError`
* Build
  * Use _TypeScript_ `v5.0.4` now, was `v4.9.5`. ([#549] via [#644])
  * Use _Webpack_ `v5.80.0` now, was `5.79.0`. (via [#686])

## 1.13.3 - 2023-04-05

* Fixed
  * `Serialize.{JSON,XML}.Normalize.LicenseNormalizer.normalizeIterable()` now omits invalid license combinations ([#602] via [#623])  
    If there is any `Models.LicenseExpression`, then this is the only license normalized; otherwise all licenses are normalized. 
* Docs
  * Fixed link to CycloneDX-specification in README (via [#617])

## 1.13.2 - 2023-03-29

* Fixed
  * `Builders.FromNodePackageJson.ComponentBuilder` no longer cuts component's name after a slash(`/`) ([#599] via [#600])

[#599]: https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-javascript-library/issues/599
[#600]: https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-javascript-library/pull/600

## 1.13.1 - 2023-03-28

* Docs
  * Announce and annotate the generator for BOM's SerialNumber ([#588] via [#598])
  
[#598]: https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-javascript-library/pull/598

## 1.13.0 - 2023-03-28

* Fixed
  * "Bom.serialNumber" data model can have values following the alternative format allowed in CycloneDX XML specification ([#588] via [#597])
  * `Serialize.{JSON,XML}.Normalize.BomNormalizer.normalize` now omits invalid/unsupported values for serialNumber ([#588] via [#597])
* Changed
  * Property `Models.Bom.serialNumber` is of type `string`, was type-aliased `Types.UrnUuid = string` ([#588] via [#597])  
    Also, the setter no longer throws exceptions, since no string format is illegal.  
    This is considered a non-breaking behavior change, because the corresponding normalizers assure valid data results.
* Added
  * Published generator for BOM's SerialNumber: `Utils.BomUtility.randomSerialNumber()` ([#588] via [#597])  
    The code was donated from [cyclonedx-node-npm](https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-node-npm/).
* Deprecation
  * Type alias `Types.UrnUuid = string` became deprecated (via [#597])  
    Use type `string` instead.
  * Function `Types.isUrnUuid` became deprecated (via [#597])

## 1.12.0 - 2023-03-02

* Docs
  * Made it clear, that `{Builders,Factories}.{FromNodePackageJson,FromPackageJson}.*` functionality is to be run on already normalized structures. ([#517] via [#518])  
    Normalization should be done downstream, for example via [`normalize-package-data`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/normalize-package-data).

    * `Models.Component.externalReferences[distribution].url` -> `PackageURL.qualifiers.download_url`
    * Method `Factories.PackageUrlFactory.makeFromComponent()` got a new optional parameter `sort`,
      to indicate whether to go the extra mile and bring hashes and qualifiers in alphabetical order.  
      This feature switch is related to reproducible builds.
* Deprecated
  * The sub-namespace `FromPackageJson` will be known as `FromNodePackageJson`. (via [#148])
    * `Factories.FromPackageJson` -> `Factories.FromNodePackageJson`
    * `Builders.FromPackageJson` -> `Builders.FromNodePackageJson`

## 1.1.0 - 2022-07-29

* Added
  * Support for nested/bundled (sub-)components via `Models.Component.components` was added, including
    serialization/normalization of models and impact on dependency graphs rendering. ([#132] via [#136])
  * [_CycloneDX_ Specification][CycloneDX-specification]-1.4 made element `Models.Component.version` optional.
    Therefore, serialization/normalization with this specification version will no longer render this element
    if its value is empty. (via [#137], [#138])

## 1.0.3 - 2022-07-28

* Fixed
  * `Types.isCPE()` for CPE2.3 allows escaped(`\`) chars `&"><`, as expected. (via [#134])

[#134]: https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-javascript-library/pull/134

## 1.0.2 - 2022-07-26

Maintenance release.

* Dependencies
  * Widened the range of requirement `packageurl-js` to `>=0.0.6 <0.0.8`, was `^0.0.7`. ([#130] via [#131])

## 1.0.1 - 2022-07-23

Maintenance release.

* Build
  * Use _TypeScript_ `v4.7.4` now, was `v4.6.4`. (via [#55])
* Dependencies
  * Raised the requirement of `packageurl-js` to `^0.0.7`, was `^0.0.6`. (via [#123])

## 1.0.0 - 2022-06-20

Initial release.

* Responsibilities
  * Provide a general purpose _JavaScript_-implementation of [_CycloneDX_][CycloneDX] for _Node.js_ and _WebBrowsers_.
  * Provide typing for said implementation, so developers and dev-tools can rely on it.
  * Provide data models to work with _CycloneDX_.
  * Provide a JSON- and an XML-normalizer, that...
    * supports all shipped data models.
    * respects any injected [_CycloneDX_ Specification][CycloneDX-specification] and generates valid output according to it.
    * can be configured to generate reproducible/deterministic output.
    * can prepare data structures for JSON- and XML-serialization.
  * Serialization:
    * Provide a universal JSON-serializer for all target environments.
    * Provide an XML-serializer for all target environments.
    * Support the downstream implementation of custom XML-serializers tailored to specific environments  
      by providing an abstract base class that takes care of normalization and BomRef-discrimination.  
      This is done, because there is no universal XML support in _JavaScript_.
* Capabilities & Features
  * Enums for the following use cases:
    * `AttachmentEncoding`
    * `ComponentScope`
    * `ComponentType`
    * `ExternalReferenceType`
    * `HashAlgorithm`
  * Data models for the following use cases:
    * `Attachment`
    * `Bom`
    * `BomRef`, `BomRefRepository`
    * `Component`, `ComponentRepository`
    * `ExternalReference`, `ExternalReferenceRepository`
    * `HashContent`, `Hash`, `HashRepository`
    * `LicenseExpression`, `NamedLicense`, `SpdxLicense`, `LicenseRepository`
    * `Metadata`
    * `OrganizationalContact`, `OrganizationalContactRepository`
    * `OrganizationalEntity`
    * `SWID`
    * `Tool`, `ToolRepository`
  * Factories for the following use cases:
    * Create data models from any license descriptor string
    * Specific to _Node.js_: create data models from PackageJson-like data structures
  * Builders for the following use cases:
    * Specific to _Node.js_: create deep data models from PackageJson-like data structures
  * Implementation of the [_CycloneDX_ Specification][CycloneDX-specification] for the following versions:
    * `1.4`
    * `1.3`
    * `1.2`
  * Normalizers that convert data models to JSON structures
  * Normalizers that convert data models to XML structures
  * Universal serializer that converts `Bom` data models to JSON string
  * Serializer that converts `Bom` data models to XML string:
    * Specific to _WebBrowsers_: implementation utilizes browser-specific document generators and printers.
    * Specific to _Node.js_: implementation plugs/requires/utilizes one of the following _optional_ libraries
      * [xmlbuilder2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xmlbuilder2)
