# ??? should the src/ and tests/ and build-related files be ignored?
# Sources are not to be excluded, as TypeScript-users would love to have sources (and tests),
# so they can compile into the desired target themselves.
# Tests, on he other hand, do not provide value downstream.
# Conclusion: have sources shipped, as long as they have value downstream!
